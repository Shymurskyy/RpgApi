# Rpg_Api
RPG_API is a .NET WebAPI project that serves as the backend for a role-playing game (RPG) application. It has all the CRUD functionalities.
I suggest you open this project with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), 
make sure to have the proper [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/visual-studio-sdks) installed and then in the terminal you enter `dotnet watch run`.
